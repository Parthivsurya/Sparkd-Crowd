# CrowdWatch - IoT Crowd Monitoring System

CrowdWatch is a comprehensive React-based dashboard designed for real-time crowd monitoring and analytics. It serves as the frontend interface for an IoT-based Stall Monitoring System, visualizing data captured by ESP32-CAM modules to help identifying engaging stalls, improving event planning, and managing crowd safety.

## 🚀 Features

- **Live Monitor (Dashboard)**: Real-time visualization of crowd density across different zones (e.g., Main Entrance, Food Court).
- **Analytics Module**: Historical data tracking with interactive charts for visitor trends and peak hours.
- **Image Processing**: Manual upload feature for processing crowd images using custom algorithms.
- **System Status**: Live status monitoring of connected IoT devices (ESP32-CAMs).
- **Settings & Alerts**: Configurable thresholds for crowd density alerts and system notifications.
